# Proj 2

* Please do `chmod 755 src/run.sh` if there is a permission error
* Please use `sudo docker-compose up` WITHOUT `-d` to see the test cases, because in test cases, we're using `stdout`
*  **IMPORTANT:** everytime you run sudo docker-compose up, the test will run and takes about 20 seconds or so to finish, which means **our proxy is ready for requests after about 20 seconds!**
